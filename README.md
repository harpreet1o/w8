### Simple Express session demo

The first time you visit the site from a browser, your "session" is created. The Session ID is sent in the response as a Cookie (`Set-Cookie` header)

On subsequent visits, the browser sends a Cookie with the Session ID in the previous step. This Session ID uniquely identifies the "Session". Other values associated with this Session ID is stored in memory

Upon going to a new incognito tab, you'll see that a new Session is created

To convince yourself that it's actually the Session Cookie that's enabling this magic, go to Network tab. Remember to check "Preserve log". You'll see the `connect.sid=` stuff in the Cookie.

Set the `cookie maxAge` in `server.js` to a larger number for this experiment. With the network tab open to `http://localhost:3000`, refresh till you get to 5 views. Then copy paste the Cookie content

Send 10 of these requests in Postman, then back to your original browser
